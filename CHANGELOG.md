### Breaking Changes
- No breaking changes in this release.

### Added
- **Functionality:** Added `get_commit_changes_modified()` to retrieve modified files between commits.
  - This new function can be used to identify the specific files that have been changed between any two commit points, aiding in more targeted and efficient development workflows.

### Changed
- **Tests:**
  - Updated tests to include functionality for `get_commit_changes_modified()`.
  - Improved commit reference handling within the test suite.
  
- **Utility Files:** Moved necessary utility functions from deleted files into existing ones (`changelog_generator.py`, `changelog_utils.py`).
  - Adjusted these scripts to ensure they continue functioning as expected without any changes in their existing behavior.

### Removed
- **Files:**
  - Removed `CHANGELOG.md` and the entire project structure including configuration files such as `__init__.py`, `changelog_config.py`, `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`, and others.
  - This includes:
    - `__pycache__/` directories (e.g., `__init__.cpython-312.pyc`)
    - Egg-info related files (e.g., `changelog_generator.egg-info/PKG-INFO`, `changelog_generator.egg-info/SOURCES.txt`)
    - Test initialization file (`tests/__init__.py`) and its corresponding `__pycache__/` directory.
  
### Fixed
- No specific bug fixes noted in this release.

### Dependencies
